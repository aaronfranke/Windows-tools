# Windows-tools

A batch script to install useful programs on Windows machines.

For the most part, this script wraps around a pre-selected list of apps via [just-install](https://github.com/just-install/just-install).

To use this program, run `Install Main Software.bat`

Not all software is included in the script. If you want those programs, manually click on the links and download them. 

Here is the list of programs included in just-install: 7zip ccleaner dotnet dropbox firefox gimp git gitkraken google-chrome itch libreoffice malwarebytes mono qbittorrent steam teamviewer visual-studio-code vlc windirstat youtube-dl
